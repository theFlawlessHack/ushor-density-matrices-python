# Use of density matrices to study observations of the U.S. House of Representatives 

## Abstract
A density matrix is a matrix that describes the statistical state of a system.
Traditionally in physics, the density matrix is applied when dealing with mixed
states, which consist of a statistical ensemble of several diï¬€erent quantum sys
tems. Mixed states arise in situations where the experimenter does not know
which particular states are being manipulated. Examples include a system with
an uncertain preparation history. In this honor project, we look at the pro
portional representation of all parties in the U.S. House of Representatives
before and after the election observations. We do so for all elections to the U.S.
House of Representatives from the founding of the republic until present.
We then determine the empirical expectation value of density matrix for the
U.S. House of Representatives. The result would yield information such
as (1) the probability of that a party that was in the majority before an elec
tion would become a minority party afterward (and vice versa); the probability
that a party that was not represented in the U.S. House of Representatives
before an election would have representation there afterward.
